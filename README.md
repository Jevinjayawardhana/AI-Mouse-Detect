# Hand Tracking Robot Arm Simulation

This project demonstrates hand tracking with a simulated robot arm using Python. The robot arm is visualized in a separate Pygame window, while the hand tracking is performed using OpenCV and Mediapipe. The robot arm's movement is based on the position of the user's hand.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using Mediapipe.
- Simulated robot arm with palm and extending segments displayed using Pygame.
- Mouse movement and clicking control based on hand gestures.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Dependencies

Install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui pygame
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-tracking-robot-arm.git
cd hand-tracking-robot-arm
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python mouse_controlller_using_hand.py
A webcam feed window will appear, and a separate Pygame window will show the robot arm simulation. Move your hand to control the robot arm and the mouse pointer. Clicking is simulated when the thumb and index finger are close together.

Code Overview
mouse_controlller_using_hand.py: Main script for hand tracking and robot arm simulation.
Uses OpenCV for webcam feed.
Uses Mediapipe for hand landmark detection.
Uses Pygame for robot arm visualization.
Integrates pyautogui for mouse control.
